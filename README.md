## Skill Demonstration Project
### Overview:
"This is a self-paced, independent project that will allow you to showcase your skills and methodology in accomplishing the chosen tasks. We like to point out that there is no single correct way to accomplish the tasks as many of them are open to interpretation. We also like to point out that the process and showcasing the process with the use of a ppt presentation is just as important as the finished product of your work. It is for this reason we encourage people to think of the storyline and presentation in advance of your project presentation. Lastly, this project will not be graded, or scored, instead, the goal is for you to show your ability to the managers in this alternate format. Their judgement will be: does this candidate have this skill, yes or no?"

### Instructions:
You will work independently on this project, but you are welcome to research the best practices online or brush up on your skills. You will have until your scheduled project presentation work on the project. During this time you will present your work to the managers by way of a thorough walk-through of your process. This should include initial ideas, roadblocks, trial & error, tools/tech used to solve the problem, and a step-by-step explanation of your process. Hiring managers will then be able to ask questions related to the work you did and the skills you utilized to complete the demo. (Note: For some roles, there may be multiple options of tasks/tabs below.)

### Goal:
The purpose of these exercises are to give candidates a different platform to prove their abilities instead of utilizing a traditional interview experience. Through a skill demonstration, candidates have a topic to discuss that can be prepared in advance, theoretically lowering anxiety and focusing on the skills that matter.

## Time Keep Co
### Overview:
Highlight your skills using the customer persona and prompt

### Instructions:
Utilizing the persona below, follow the instructions, document your steps, and present your work to the hiring manager.

### Persona:
Your customer is the (fictional) Chief Financial Officer of a company called "Time Keep CO." The organization is a watch and watch parts company distributed globally. They are hiring you as an independent contractor to work on the following tasks:

### Task:
"Transaction Records: Time Keep Co has two files that need to be scanned for errors and rectifying. These files list many customer transactions along with a Service Code and what is called a ""SPA"" for each transaction. The two files and their records of each transaction should match, but they do not. Each individual transaction can be identified by its unique combination of Service Code and SPA. Time Keep Co needs you to identify any discrepancies between the two files and report them back to be corrected."

### Data Set/ Scenario:
Task Description: Ship Keep Co has two files that need to be scanned for errors and rectifying. These files list many customer transactions which are identified by a Service Code and what is called a "SPA" for each transaction. The two files should match, but the do not. Each individual transaction can be identified by its unique combination of Service Code and SPA (corresponding columns will be found in each file). Ship Keep Co needs you to identify any discrepancies between the transaction records in the two files and report them back to be corrected.

### Recommended Tools:
Python / SQL

Write a script to help in reading the files and checking that the data of each transaction matches in both files. Your script should input each CSV file and use the combination of SPA and Service Code in each row as a key to match each transaction between the two files. Your script should identify discrepancies that may be present in corresponding transactions as well as identify any transactions that appear in one file and not in the other.

Make sure that, when the file runs, it produces a clear output of discrepancies which identify the transaction by SPA and Service Code and label what is wrong with the data (missing in one file, which file is missing it, or mismatched data in a matched transaction).
